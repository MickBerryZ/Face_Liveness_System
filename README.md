# Face_Antispoofing_System

This is a Face_Liveness_system_python that I implement by using google Colab, 
Thank you for Original https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGSR_3IEIwc to explain the code.

The step explain to follow below
1. Data Preprocessing ||
Step 1: Create new directory structure for the datasets ||
Step 2: Copying images imto new directory structure ||
Step 3: Dataset Exploration ||
Step 4: Dataset Visualization ||

2. Training Dataset Visualization
3. Testing Dataset Visualization
4. Step Of Model Preparation ||
Step 1: Choosing Framework and importing necessary libraies ||
Step 2: Load datasets and perform image augmentations ||
Step 3: Model selection ||
Step 4: Compiling our model ||
Step 5: Setting our model checkpoints ||

5. Serialize model to JSON
6. Clone my project (follow on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGSR_3IEIwc)
7. Setting Conda (follow on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGSR_3IEIwc)
8. Copy and Paste model file and json that my program training and test
9. Change path on livenet_net.py
10. Run and Test
